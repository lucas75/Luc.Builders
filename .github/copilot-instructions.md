- Explore Net 9.0 and C# 13 features.
- Follow existing coding style and conventions in the codebase.
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Build before testing
- Do NOT modify generated files directly. These files will include a marker such as a header comment with `// <auto-generated/>` or files using the pattern `<generated>` in the name. Treat those as read-only.
- Prefer immutability and `readonly` fields where meaningful.
- Split large methods in smaller helper methods for clarity.

AI agent verification checklist
------------------------------
1. Environment & SDK check
   - Ensure `dotnet --list-sdks` includes .NET 9.0 or above.
   - Abort if no supported SDK is detected.

2. Build & test
   - Run `dotnet build && dotnet test` and fail if there are build/test errors.

3. Sanitization & security
   - Do not interpolate untrusted input into generated source. Always sanitize or validate input.
