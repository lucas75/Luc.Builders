# Lwx.Builders.MicroService - Project Context Summary

## Current Project State

This is a Roslyn incremental source generator for C# microservice archetypes, targeting .NET 9.0 with C# 13 features. The generator processes custom attributes to automatically generate ASP.NET Core microservice boilerplate code including endpoints, DTOs, consumers, producers, and Swagger documentation.

## Architecture Overview

- **Generator**: `Generator.cs` (class `Generator`) orchestrates the generation process using incremental generators
- **Processors**: Object-oriented design with individual processor classes (e.g., `LwxEndpointTypeProcessor`, `LwxDtoTypeProcessor`) that implement `Execute()` methods
- **Attributes**: Embedded as resources with LogicalName for proper resource naming
- **Primary Constructors**: Used throughout for clean parameter handling
- **Diagnostic System**: Custom error codes (LWX001-LWX005) for compile-time validation

## Recent Development History
 - Modified the auto-generated Program.g.cs to place the Main method as top-level statements, enhancing the ServiceConfig class by calling its Configure methods for builder and app configuration.
 - Enhanced incremental source generator to detect ServiceConfig classes by name and validate their Configure methods for correct signatures (public static void Configure(WebApplicationBuilder) or Configure(WebApplication)), reporting diagnostics LWX014 and LWX015 for invalid signatures or unexpected public methods.
 - Enforced presence of `ServiceConfig.cs` in projects using the generator (diagnostic LWX011).
 - Enforced presence of `ServiceConfig.cs` in projects using the generator (diagnostic LWX011).
 - Enforced that `[LwxServiceConfig]` may only appear in a file named `ServiceConfig.cs` (diagnostic LWX012).
 - DTO processing and attributes have been moved to a dedicated project `Lwx.Builders.Dto` (see that project for `LwxDto` attributes and processors)
 - DTO processing and attributes have been moved to a dedicated project `Lwx.Builders.Dto`. That project now contains the DTO attributes (`Attributes/`), processors (`Processors/`), and its own incremental generator (`DtoGenerator.cs`). Consumers add it as an analyzer (ProjectReference with ReferenceOutputAssembly="false") to get DTO attribute embedding and generation.
- Added `[LwxDtoIgnoreAttribute]` for excluding properties from generation while satisfying validation rules
- Centralized attribute name constants in `LwxConstants.cs` with `const string` for full names and `static readonly string` for short names using `Replace("Attribute", "")`
 - Moved small shared helper types into `Processors/ProcessorUtils.cs` and centralized `LwxConstants` to make processors more self-contained. The lightweight attribute model (`AttributeInstance`) now lives at the generator root in `GeneratorUtils.cs` so both the generator and processors share the same representation.
- Refactored `Generator.cs` to use constants from the nested `LwxConstants` in switch statements and attribute detection
 - Moved attribute parsing helper out of `Generator.cs` into `GeneratorUtils.cs` as `GeneratorUtils.ResolveAttributeInstance(GeneratorSyntaxContext)` to make the logic reusable and clearer.
- Moved `AttributeNames` array from generator to `LwxConstants` for better maintainability
 - Encapsulated Swagger configuration in dynamically generated `LwxConfigure` extension methods, using `[LwxServiceConfig]` metadata to conditionally include Swagger setup code
 - Upgraded Swagger generation to respect `PublishSwagger` property with environment-based activation (Development/Production stages), and set OpenAPI info (Title, Description, Version) and Swagger UI DocumentTitle from attribute properties
- Removed embedded `LwxEndpointExtensions.cs` template, replaced with dynamic generation in main generator for attribute-aware code inclusion
 - Removed legacy `LwxEndpoint_Generated_{name}` marker classes from generated outputs; endpoint generation is now consolidated into a single generated file matching the endpoint class name (for example `EndpointAbcCde.g.cs`) containing the endpoint partial with `Configure`.
 - Removed embedded `LwxEndpointExtensions.cs` template and csproj embedding — endpoint extension helpers are now dynamically generated by `Generator.cs` at runtime in consuming projects. This reduces template duplication and keeps generated outputs consistent with attribute metadata.
 - Updated `LwxServiceConfigTypeProcessor` to minimal diagnostic checking, with actual generation moved to main generator
- Ensured clean builds with no runtime dependencies on generator assembly, maintaining embedded source distribution pattern

### Endpoint Naming & Namespace/Filepath Validation (Latest)
- Revised endpoint naming validation to support multiple acceptable class-name styles derived from the HTTP URI:
  - Full segment style: EndpointAbcCdeEfg for GET /abc/cde/efg
  - Verb-suffix style: EndpointAbcCdeEfgGet (or EndpointAbcCdeGet) — generator accepts useful variants for ergonomics
  - Parameter naming: uses ParamX for path parameters (eg. EndpointAbcParamCdeEfg)
- Generator now supports placing generated endpoint classes in nested folders/namespaces (e.g. .Endpoints, .Endpoints.Abc, .Endpoints.Abc.Cde) and will generate mapping helpers accordingly
- Added strict filename/namespace matching validation for classes with Lwx attributes (diagnostic LWX007). The rule enforces that types are declared in files that match the namespace -> path layout. Example: type MyCompany.MyProject.Abc.Cde should be located at Abc/Cde.cs relative to the project root namespace
- Applied the namespace/path validation across processors (endpoints, DTOs, workers, bus consumers/producers, timers, swagger) so any Lwx-decorated type is validated at compile time
 - Added support for explicit naming exceptions via the attribute property `NamingExceptionJustification` on `[LwxEndpoint]`. When provided the generator will accept a non-standard class name and emit an informational diagnostic (LWX008) that includes the justification.

### Completed DTO Processor Implementation (Previous)
- Implemented `LwxDtoTypeProcessor` to generate partial property implementations for DTO classes
- Added `DtoType` enum with `Normal` (backing fields) and `Dictionary` (dynamic storage) options
 - Created `LwxDtoPropertyAttribute` for customizing JSON serialization (JsonName, JsonConverter) — now located in `Lwx.Builders.Dto/Attributes` and supported by the `Lwx.Builders.Dto` generator
- Added support for `JsonIgnore` on nullable properties and `JsonStringEnumConverter` for enums
- Implemented type validation with diagnostics for unsupported property types
- Added enum constant validation to warn missing `JsonPropertyName` attributes
- Updated attribute embedding to include new DTO-related attributes

### Completed Refactoring (Previous)
- Refactored large `Execute()` method in `LwxEndpointTypeProcessor` into focused private methods:
  - `ExtractUriArgument()` - URI extraction from attributes
  - `ValidateEndpointNaming()` - Naming scheme validation with diagnostics
  - `ComputeEndpointNames()` - Namespace and class name computation
  - `ExtractAttributeMetadata()` - Security/summary/description/publish metadata
  - `GenerateSourceFiles()` - Multi-file source generation

### Previous Major Changes
- Migrated from static dispatch to object-oriented processor instantiation
- Added primary constructors to all processor classes
- Suppressed unused parameter warnings (CS9113) at project level
- Enhanced endpoint generation with Configure methods
- Added metadata validation and diagnostic reporting
- Organized processors into modular classes
- Standardized embedded resource usage
- Refactored duplicated code to utility classes
- Added Swagger processor with dependency validation
- Improved attribute documentation with XML docs

## Established Patterns

### Code Style
- C# 13 with primary constructors and pattern matching
- PascalCase naming for all identifiers
- Comprehensive XML documentation for public APIs
- Immutable readonly properties preferred
- Split large methods into smaller helpers

### Source Generation
- Raw string literals ($$"""...""") for generated code
  - Follow global policy: all generators must use raw $$""" templates with no embedded leading indentation, and apply `.FixIndent(levels)` when composing templates. See `/.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the canonical rules. If this file previously suggested a different approach, it was intentionally replaced to follow the global guidance.
 - File naming patterns: by default `Endpoint<TypeName>.g.cs` (for example `EndpointAbcCde.g.cs`); when a `NamingExceptionJustification` is present the generator will include the full namespace in the filename to disambiguate (for example `ExampleOrg.Product.ServiceAbc.Endpoints.EndpointOldStart.g.cs`).
 - Use file-scoped namespaces in generated files when possible (e.g. `namespace ExampleOrg.Product.ServiceAbc.Endpoints;`) to reduce indentation and produce cleaner output.
- Namespace computation: Strip ".Endpoints" suffixes for root namespaces
- Diagnostic reporting with custom descriptors and location info

### Project Configuration
  - Embedded resources use LogicalName: `Lwx.Builders.MicroService.%(RelativeDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)`
- Project-level warning suppressions in NoWarn
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore dependency for Swagger features
- **Deployment Note**: Attributes in `Attributes/` and templates in `Templates/` are embedded as source and generated in consuming projects via post-initialization. Incremental source generators must never use `ReferenceOutputAssembly=true` to avoid runtime dependencies on the generator assembly.

### Validation Rules
- Endpoint naming: `EndpointAbc` for path `/abc`, `EndpointAbcParamDef` for `/abc/{def}`
- Namespace requirement: Endpoints must be in `*.Endpoints` namespaces
- Dependency checking: Validates required NuGet packages at compile-time

## Current Working State

 - All processors use primary constructors with `(AttributeInstance attr, SourceProductionContext ctx, Compilation _)` (microservice generator). The lightweight attribute model is defined at the generator root so processors can use it without duplicating types.
- Large methods have been refactored into maintainable private methods
- DTO processor generates partial property implementations with backing fields or dictionary storage
- Build passes cleanly with no errors (warnings for nullable in generated code)
- Tests pass successfully
 - Tests pass successfully for the solution; `Lwx.Builders.Dto` also includes its own unit/integration coverage in the solution test run.
- Ready for continued development of additional processor types or feature enhancements
