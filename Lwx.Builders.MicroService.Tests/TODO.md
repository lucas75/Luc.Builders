# TODO - Lwx.Builders.MicroService.Tests

- [x] Create sample projects for testing generator output
    - Note: ErrorService sample project has been removed; generator diagnostics are now validated with in-memory sources via `GeneratorTestHarness` in `CompileErrorTests.cs`.

Notes: Do not create tests yet; compile-time tests will be added later in test suite to validate presence of diagnostics in build output.
